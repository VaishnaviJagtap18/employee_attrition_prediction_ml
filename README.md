# Employee Attrition Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## 📌 Problem Statement
A multinational company is experiencing an increasing number of employee resignations, leading to higher recruitment costs, project delays, and loss of skilled talent.
The goal of this project is to build an intelligent Machine Learning system that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on factors such as:
- Job Satisfaction  
- Salary  
- Age  
- Work-Life Balance  
- Training Hours  
- Bonuses  
- Other HR-related features  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a **Logistic Regression model**
- Improve performance using **L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization**
- Compare model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- Recommend the best model for employee attrition prediction
